# Memory Card Game

## Are you up for the challenge!

Test your memory and brainpower in this classic game of memorization. Can you successfully match all images before time runs out? Can you complete the challenge with the least amount of attempts. See if you're up for the challenge. Come and test your brain power.

In this game you'll have the chance to successfully match 12 different pairs with as few attempts as possible. First flip one card and then try and see where the matching pair is located. If unsuccesful both images will return to the face down position and you'll have the chance to flip 2 more cards for a chance to make a pair. But dont forget which images you last saw as it will help you with your next choice.

Note: Will use Javascript, HTML and CSS to style and create game. Will utilize features to create a timer that runs out if unsuccessful. Buttons to start and clear game in order re-start.

For this project I utilized basic HTML, CSS and JS to render a functioning game. The construction of the game used basic CSS positioning, attributes, transitions and styling features. For JS I went with basic callback functions, iterators and DOM events.
